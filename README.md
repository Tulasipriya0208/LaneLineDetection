# LaneLineDetection
Lane Line Detection is a task that detects various types of lane lines on the road and set a path for the vehicle to
steer without any driver assistance. The concept Lane Line Detection is used in Self-driving cars or autonomous
vehicles.
Nowadays road accidents have become rising problem. In order to improve driver safety and avoid risks, systems
like Lane Line Detection were being developed and used. A person driving a vehicle can detect lane lines by his
own but systems like autonomous vehicles or self-driving vehicles need assistance to drive accordingly. With the
advancement of technology, availability of vast datasets and computational power, models can be build that creates
a pipeline for the vehicle to steer without any manual assistance.
